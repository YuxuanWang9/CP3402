# Week 4
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I learned how to deploy a simple local database using MongoDB and how to access it using Node.js. Additionally, I tried out the free cloud-based MongoDB database offered by Atlas. I found the cloud-based database to be more convenient, particularly for our current lightweight application with minimal data usage. The cloud database eliminates the need for local service startup and is, in fact, a faster solution, which I find worth continuing to explore.

At the same time, I've done a lot of supplementary reading this week, which discussed tracking a project. I delved into understanding how to decompose requirements, split feature points, abstract features, create git branches, collaborate using git, and manage version control through git documentation, among other teamwork-related skills.

## Estimated Hours
This week, I spent over ten hours learning how to initiate a project and see it through to completion.

## Content Insights
I gained a lot of knowledge this week:
1. I have learned how to locally launch a localhost and deploy services in the cloud to provide a back-end MongoDB database service. I've also explored the various differences between local and cloud launches. For instance, local setups perform well when starting multiple databases to assemble numerous fields, but cloud-based operations may be slower due to the time required for data transmission. Furthermore, for lightweight applications, cloud databases are a better option because of their fast startup, deployment, and scalability, making them a superior choice for quick setup.

2. I've also acquired a wealth of project management experience, ranging from initial project decomposition to requirement segmentation, followed by requirement abstraction, then collaborative work, and finally, the testing and delivery phase, leading up to subsequent iterative updates. These are all essential pieces of knowledge that I need to understand. In the future, both in my studies and work, I'll need to proficiently manage the project pace and collaborate effectively with others.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week, I delved deeper into the study of database architecture, learning about the capacity limitations and the pros and cons in various scenarios. Since databases are a crucial component of project infrastructure, gaining a solid understanding of database architecture will offer significant advantages when it comes to assessing projects in my future career.

Moreover, I have gained a wealth of project management insights from additional readings, which have been greatly beneficial for both my upcoming group studies and professional life. I've learned about the entire process, from initiating a project and breaking down requirements, to completing the project and managing subsequent iterations, which has been incredibly helpful to me.
