# Week 2

## Learning Activities & Resources
* This week I primarily focused on learning how to create a website and exploring various CSS styles to meet the aesthetic requirements of my client (professor). I learned the basic programming techniques for building a website on the [Making Website with HTML tutorial](https://www.hostinger.com/tutorials/making-website-with-html).
* Additionally, I explored the examples provided by Bootstrap to further enhance the appearance of my website once it reaches an initial stage of development. Here is the link to [Bootstrap Examples](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.3/examples/).
## Estimated Hours
I spent around nine hours this week learning how to start coding a website.

## Content Insights
* Compared to using Siteground and Joomla last week, I found Joomla to be more complex in its initial usage. I had trouble at first and had to refer to the Joomla readme to understand how to start creating a website and deploy it online for others to access.
* This week, I also started using Visual Studio Code to write simple websites. Currently, everything is written within a single HTML file, including content and styles. I hope to separate the CSS styles and utilize Bootstrap to create visually appealing styles in the future.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
* During these two weeks of learning, I realized the benefits of being familiar with various web service providers. It allows me to offer clients more choices within their budget range, such as faster service, greater stability, quick deployment, or cost-effectiveness. Having knowledge of different service providers enables me to provide clients with a wider range of options and showcase my professionalism.
