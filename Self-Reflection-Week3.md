# Week 3
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I got to know the cloud service providers in China. To build a website using a Chinese cloud service, you need to purchase a domain name, verify its real name and register it with the relevant government department. After waiting for a week or two for the registration approval, you can download addon domain to your server. Only at this point, the website is accessed from the public Internet. The whole process can be understood by visiting the following websites, although the content is in Chinese: [https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/243](https://cloud.tencent.com/document/product/243)

## Estimated Hours
I spent six hours this week learning the relevant material.

## Content Insights
I gained a lot of knowledge this week:
1. I learned about the differences between cloud services in China and those in other parts of the world. China focuses more on regulation, while other regions emphasize service, freedom, and privacy. However, the performance of cloud services is robust both in China and elsewhere, with capabilities for scaling and expanding on demand.
2. I explored how to use WordPress for building websites and the roles of various plugins, which can, for example, enhance SEO, improve audience segmentation, and identify hot zones that interest users. These tools are particularly beneficial for businesses in tracking customer preferences and making targeted product recommendations.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
This week, I learned more about the industry deployment strategies and the different focuses of various platforms. Each platform actively promoting its own advantages through a series of different activities. I believe that in my future career, I will be able to focus on recommending different cloud providers according to different customers' different budgets. As a national of China, I'm familiar with cloud products in China. For example, Alibaba Cloud is famous for its stability and performance, while Tencent Cloud is famous for its flexibility, extensive services and faster registration processes.
