# Week 6
## Learning Activities & Resources
This week, I created a GitHub repo and invited my team members to join our project. During this process, I learned the basics of git from this page: [https://github.com/git-guides/git-init](https://github.com/git-guides/git-init).

I also explored how to use Trello and its application to our project on the following page: [https://trello.com/integrations](https://trello.com/integrations).


## Estimated Hours
This week, I spent 6 hours on this subject, mainly focusing on assigning tasks with my teammates and discussing how to complete our assignments.

## Content Insights
The core components of Trello are boards, lists, and cards. These components help users organize projects, track task progress, and collaborate.

1. Boards: Represent a project or a work domain, a space where tasks and activities can be created.
2. Lists: Typically represent different stages of the task workflow, such as "To Do," "In Progress," and "Completed."
3. Cards: Signify specific tasks or items, to which detailed information can be added, such as descriptions, comments, attachments, due dates, labels, and assignment to specific members.

Trello is very suitable for agile development processes, but its flexibility allows it to adapt to a variety of different workflows and management needs.

Furthermore, I also studied how to operate git and created a local branch for future project use:

1. git clone: Pull the repository from online to local.
2. git status: Check the current branch status to view the history of commits in the current branch.
3. git pull & git push: Pull the latest code submitted by team members, and push updated code (like a README) based on their changes back to the repository.
4. git init: Initialize a local git repository.

## Career/Employability/Learning Insights
The knowledge I learned this week should be skills that will be used every day in my future career:

### In the first half hour of work:
- Review the commits made by colleagues on the latest project branch (updated code).
- Track project progress in Trello, update tasks for the day, check if the overall project is on schedule, and assess potential risks that could delay the project launch.

### During work hours:
- Update code and commit changes to the project branch in a timely manner to prevent loss of information due to computer damage.
- Update project progress in Trello to keep the team leader and members informed about the progress, manage risks, and allocate tasks more effectively.

### As work approaches the end of the day:
- Perform a final `git push`. If team members have also committed to the same branch, it may be necessary to merge their branches.
- Update the day's progress in Trello, summarizing what has been accomplished.
