## Learning Activities & Resources

1. Customize the Parent Themes: You can modify the styles, functions and behavior of a parent theme to meet your needs without affecting the source code of the parent theme.
2. Convenient Updates: When a parent theme is updated, you can easily update your child theme without losing any customized modifications.
3. Manage multiple websites: If you are managing multiple websites with the same parent theme, you can make a modifications by creating a sub-theme and then applying it across all the websites. 

## Estimated Hours
This week, I spent nine hours studying.

## Content Insights
The specific steps for replacing a WordPress theme with a subtopic are as follows.

### Create a Child Theme Directory
Create a subdirectory named "child-theme" in WordPress theme directory. For instance, if the parent theme directory is named "twentynineteen," then the child theme directory should be named "twentynineteen-child."

### Add a Child Theme Stylesheet
Within the subtopic directory, create a file named "style.css". This file will define the styles of my child theme.

### Modify Child Theme Styles
Website owner can add CSS styles to the "style.css" file as required to customize owner's subtopics.

### Activate the child Theme
In the WordPress dashboard, navigate to the theme "Appearance", "Find the child theme and activate it.

### Implement further customizations
If necessary, website owner can add JavaScript files (such as "script.js") and template files (such as "header.php", "footer.php", etc.) in the sub-topic directory, so as to realize wider customization functions.
